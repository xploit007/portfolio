Portfolio Blueprint: A Section-by-Section Guide for You
1. Homepage
Your Photo: Professional headshot.
Headline: Let's craft a powerful one based on your resume.
Option A (Focus on BA): "Business Analyst translating complex requirements into data-driven solutions on AWS and Azure."
Option B (Focus on Analytics): "Data & Business Analyst specializing in predictive modeling and interactive dashboards to drive strategic decisions."

Sub-headline: A brief 2-3 sentence summary. "I thrive at the intersection of business and technology, converting stakeholder needs into actionable user stories and building end-to-end analytical solutions. My experience spans from AWS data integration and Power BI reporting to deploying NLP models with Python."
Call-to-Action Buttons: "View My Projects", "My Process", "Download Resume".
2. Projects: The Heart of Your Portfolio
This is where you'll shine. We'll transform your three academic projects into interactive, business-focused case studies. Don't just list them; tell their story.
Project 1: The "Live AI Demo" - Emotion Detection in Tweets
This is your "wow" factor project. It's tangible and impressive.
Title: Real-Time Emotion Analysis for Social Media Content
The Business Problem: Companies need to understand customer sentiment in real-time to manage brand reputation, identify product issues, and gauge marketing campaign success. Manual analysis is impossible at scale.
The Interactive Element (Your #1 Priority):
Build a Streamlit App. This is non-negotiable for this project. It's the perfect way to show, not tell.
Functionality: A simple web page with a text box. A user types in a sentence (e.g., "I'm so frustrated with the new update, it's incredibly slow.") and clicks "Analyze".
Output: Your app displays the detected emotions (e.g., Anger: 85%, Sadness: 50%, Joy: 5%) using bar charts or labels.
Deployment: Host it for free on Streamlit Community Cloud and link to it prominently from your portfolio.
The Write-up: Include sections on the model architecture (Hugging Face transformers), challenges (handling multi-label complexity), and the potential business impact (enabling proactive customer support or market research).
Project 2: The "Business Storyteller" - SDG-3 Energy Access in Afghanistan
This project demonstrates your ability to analyze trends and communicate a powerful narrative with data.
Title: A Decade of Progress: Visualizing Afghanistan's Journey to Energy Access
The Business Problem: International development agencies and governments need to track progress on key initiatives like the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to allocate resources effectively and measure the impact of policies.
The Interactive Element:
Embed an Interactive Tableau or Power BI Dashboard.
Key Visual: A line chart or an animated map showing the dramatic increase in electricity access from 1.73% to 97.71% over the years. Make it interactive so the user can hover over a year to see the exact percentage.
Supporting Visuals: Include other charts showing correlations you found or forecasts from your time-series model. Allow filtering by province if your data supports it.
The Write-up: Frame this as a "Data for Good" project. Explain your regression/time-series methodology and how these forecasts could help organizations plan for future infrastructure needs. This shows social awareness and analytical rigor.
Project 3: The "Classic Business Case" - Credit Risk Analysis
This project speaks directly to the finance and banking industries and demonstrates core data science skills.
Title: Optimizing Credit Risk Assessment with XGBoost at American Express
The Business Problem: Lenders must accurately predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan to minimize financial losses while providing fair access to credit. Traditional models can often be improved.
The Interactive Element:
Another Tableau/Power BI Dashboard. Since you list Power BI first on your resume, definitely use it here to prove your skill.
Dashboard Components:
Model Comparison: A simple bar chart showing the accuracy/AUC of your XGBoost model vs. the baseline or the CNN model.
Feature Importance: A chart showing the top 5-10 factors that predict default risk (e.g., credit utilization, income, loan age). This is highly valuable for business users.
Confusion Matrix: A visual representation of your model's performance (True Positives, False Negatives, etc.).
The Write-up: Detail your process of feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. In your "Results" section, clarify the "11.6% higher accuracy" claim (e.g., "achieved an F1-score of 0.85, which was an 11.6% improvement over the baseline logistic regression model").
3. "My Process" Page (Your Secret Weapon)
Instead of a generic "About Me," create a page that visualizes your Business Analysis process. This directly leverages your professional experience.
Use a visual diagram/flowchart:
Step 1: Discover & Define: (Icon: people talking) Keywords: Stakeholder Interviews, Requirement Gathering.
Step 2: Plan & Prioritize: (Icon: a backlog/board) Keywords: User Story Writing, Backlog Grooming, Jira, Azure DevOps.
Step 3: Develop & Analyze: (Icon: code/gears) Keywords: Python, SQL, AWS Redshift, Data Modeling, ML.
Step 4: Visualize & Deliver: (Icon: a chart/dashboard) Keywords: Power BI, Tableau, Reporting, Sprint Delivery.
Under this diagram, briefly describe how you applied this process at Ackerman and Innover Digital, using the metrics from your resume.
